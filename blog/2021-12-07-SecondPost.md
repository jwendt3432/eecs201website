## Second Post
2021-12-07

Hello blog! Since I already wrote about my day today, I'll now write about what I hope to accomplish tomorrow, December 8th. Perhaps I can even write a follow-up post tomorrow to see how successful I was. Tomorrow I hope to wake up early(easier said than done), then start with another smoothie for breakfast. After that, I want to do my physical therapy for my shoulder pretty quickly, then get started on the rest of my EECS 414 homework. I hope to finish that before the office hours in the afternoon so I can get feedback, then go to class afterwards. In the evening, I need to go to EECS 201 office hours to get this website graded, and then tomorrow evening I will just try to relax or hang out with friends.
