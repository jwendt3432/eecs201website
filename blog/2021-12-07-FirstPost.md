## First Post

Hello! This is my first blog entry, and for this one I will just provide a recap of my day. I woke up pretty late after working on homework late last night. I started the day by making a smoothie and going to the Michigan Union to get Panda Express. Next, I started on some homework for EECS 414 and worked on that for about an hour until I got stuck and needed to just wait until office hours. Next, I started on the basic 11 assignment for EECS 201 and also worked on that until I got stuck and needed help in office hours. At 3 pm, I joined office hours for EECS 414 first, then went to EECS 201 office hours and got help with basic11 and this website. Afterwards, I ate dinner then finished basic 11 and continued to work on this website. That's about it for today!
